# Effects of Entertainment on Knowledge Retention

Group members: Sam Berna, Scott Chase, Aaron Chen, Phillip Johnson

Introduction:
Technology is extremely prominent in today’s and will continue to become a more prominent part of people’s lives. This can be seen with the ratio of electronic device to person where in 2000 there were 0.03 devices per person, in 2010 there were 1.8 devices per person, and in 2020 there were 6.6 devices per person. This increasing usage of technology has also made its way into the education system where students are using computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones for watching lectures, taking notes, completing assignments, and more. This is a fundamental change to the education system and affects the way students learn and retain knowledge. The goal of this project is to explore how knowledge retention is affected by how entertaining the learning platform is. This can be used to learn about how well knowledge is retained and if the user returns to the learning platform based on the entertainment value of the platform. The results from the experience can hopefully be used to make better decisions in education and better prepare the next generation.
